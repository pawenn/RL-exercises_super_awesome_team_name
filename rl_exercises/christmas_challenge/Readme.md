# Reinforcement Learning - Christmas Challenge

In this challenge, your task is to act better than random on the `cbench-v1` benchmark dataset in the `llvm-autophase-ic-v0` environment. 
The environment only works on Linux or MacOS.
You can use [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/) or Linux Subsystem for Windows if you do not have such a system available.

You are free to use whatever RL library and algorithms you know!

The reward space is the [normalized instruction count](https://compilergym.com/llvm/index.html#ir-instruction-count).

**The episodes have no step limit by default, so remember to use the `TimeLimit` wrapper!**

**⚠ TODO: We will provide an evaluation script!**

## Levels
### Level 1
Please optimize your algorithm on the `dijkstra` benchmark as this will determine your [leaderboard](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards) (a team from 2022 is on 1st place!) position.
Use different seeds and plot training progress. If PPO does not work, vary hyperparameters or use a different algo.

Evaluate your agent(s). Plot performance, e.g. using `rliable`.

To check that your agent actually learns something, evaluate a random policy and compare evaluation performances.
(1 bonus point)

### Level 2
Evaluate your agent on the complete benchmark to determine generalization performance and plot accordingly, e.g. using box plots or `rliable`.
The benchmarks are listed in the cbench-v1.txt file.
You can find other benchmarks [here](https://compilergym.com/llvm/index.html#datasets).
Remember to evaluate agents trained on different seeds.
Plot performance on all benchmarks aggregated and on individual benchmarks, what do you notice?
(1 bonus point)

### Level 3
Beat the leaderboard on [leaderboard](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards). (1 bonus point)

--OR--

Optimize for generalization performance on the complete benchmark. Either optimize hyperparameters or use contextual RL 
with our benchmark library [CARL](https://github.com/automl/CARL). For this, create a CARLCompilerGymEnv and define the
instance space. Train on one instance and on all instances and compare performance. (1 bonus point)


## Presentation
The best performing team presents and gets a bonus point.🙂

## Installation
For this challenge you need to install `compiler_gym` which you can do with

```bash
pip install -U compiler_gym
```
If this does not work for you, try these [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/INSTALL.md).

If you use `make install`: If you have any error like "error in gym setup command: 'extras_require' must be a dictionary whose values are strings or lists of strings containing valid project/version requirement specifiers.", lower the `setuptools` version and install a specific `wheel` version (`pip install setuptools==65.5.0 wheel==0.38.4`). (Tested on Linux Subsystem)


## Getting Started
You can run training with `python rl_exercises/train_agent.py +exercise=compilergym`.

## Extra
You can also try your RL algorithms on your own custom benchmarks such as the example in the `custom_benchmarks` directory.
